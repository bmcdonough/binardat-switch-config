"""Verification test suite for Binardat switch interface.

This package contains comprehensive tests that validate all documented
behavior of the Binardat switch web interface including:

- RC4 encryption algorithm
- Authentication flow (login/logout)
- Menu structure and navigation
- Form parsing and submission
- End-to-end workflow

All tests run in read-only mode (no configuration changes) to safely
validate behavior against a live switch.
